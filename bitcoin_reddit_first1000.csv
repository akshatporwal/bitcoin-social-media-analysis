If one financial institution has to comply with regulation it doesn't make sense to me why Coinbase, another financial institution, wouldn't have to. At the very least I don't see how they could be subject to less regulation than a Forex trader.

Since we're not going to completely deregulate the banking sector; the societal will is not there, then the other option is to regulate BTC similarly.

If you have issues, work toward reforming FINRA.

If Bitcoin is not regulated, then society will grow to realize that it does not comply with society's standard's, and then it risks eradication and outright criminalization. I would not be surprised if many people are arrested under FINRA one day, regardless of warning or guidance from the SEC.

Is that what you want?

You speak of innovation, but I don't really think of Bitcoin as particularly innovative. Its just a method of circumventing regulation, but circumventing regulation is illegal and societally immoral. Circumventing regulation in any way other than modification of regulation through the democratic process is wrong.


As to your last topic about laws. Society need not prove laws work or not. Laws are created by society, and whatever society agrees upon is morally correct, no matter how arbitrary or capricious. You are of course welcome to leave society, but you will be sent out on your back, and also be forced to repay society for the education you have received and the head start in technology that education creates.

You have no personal or individual freedom. You only exist because of society. You only know how to speak because of society. Most of your knowledge other than basic experiences with the physical world, comes from society.

When you speak of yourself outside of society, you speak of nothing."

&gt; Ex-German Bank chief economist warns of paper money and socialism lead to ruin - now threaten the bondage?
&gt; Author: editorial w: o
&gt; 10.14.2014, 09:49 | 11272 views | 8 | druckversion
&gt; 
&gt; A new book could provide explosive. Posted it has Thomas Mayer, ex-chief economist at Deutsche Bank. In this he is not only the banks to blame for the financial crisis, on top of that he calls for an end of the paper money. A radical new financial order would her, otherwise threatened the destruction of our prosperity.
&gt; 
&gt; We live in a time when a financial crisis the next hunt. Central banks print more and more money, inflation rises. But through the many notes form price bubbles - bubbles that burst at some point. The result: a serious crisis. The supposed solution: more cheap money. And voilà, the vicious cycle begins again.
&gt; 
&gt; In his new book ""The New Rules of Money - Why we need monetary reform"" the Ex-top banker Thomas Mayer deals with exactly this devilish spiral and crisis calls for a radical new beginning.
&gt; 
&gt; Paper money and socialism lead to ruin
&gt; 
&gt; In his opinion, our current paper money system is to blame for the misery. Or rather, it is the central banks and banks that make more and more money out of nothing and so the stem a crisis so that they create another. This leads over time to a society's need for stability, so Mayer in an interview with "" Business Week "". States would serve this need then by intervened in the economy and capitalism gradually transferred into a socialist economic system in this way.
&gt; 
&gt; And so we would, according to Mayer exactly at that point, or that ""ism"", the liberal economist has always been the fear teaches socialism. Mayer also can be the mantra à la Friedrich von Hayek not escape and speaks of socialism that destroyed the prosperity and inevitably leads to slavery. And because the paper money in turn is just the beginning, socialism at the end of this fatal chain of causation is for Mayer clearly: ""Because socialism leads to destruction, is the credit system that promoted socialism, dangerous."" It is high time rumzureißen the helm and to preserve us from destruction. Mayer has also directly ready for a proposed solution: A new monetary system must be found.
&gt; 
&gt; Active money is credit money to replace
&gt; 
&gt; Mayer argues in favor of replacing the current credit money through ""active money"". Active money? ""Money does not materialize, in contrast to loan money through a debt ratio, but is based on an asset, says former chief economist at Deutsche Bank. The point of this money system: The money can not be increased. Banks and States is that everyone access to the creation of new money withdrawn as "" Der Spiegel notes "". Instead, the central bank in Mayers active monetary system the money directly to the citizens. Money that they do not any prints, but produces ""public confidence in the money"" by. How this would work exactly, it goes Mayer in the interview with the ""Business Week"" is not a closer. However, it is essential that people between different currencies could choose. This competition of currencies would put any issuer, such as the ECB limits and thus ensure that not too much money is spent. The radical liberalism of the ""Austrian School of Economics"" Greetings.
&gt; 
&gt; For the banks, it gets back to basics
&gt; 
&gt; And the banks? The recall in this scenario back on their core tasks, namely the securing of deposits and mediating between savers and investors. Where: A business credit can only come about if all loans are fully cover through savings. For loans from which to draw nothing, these times would be passé.
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin Euro instead?
&gt; 
&gt; So far, so good. But how should this new active money actually look like? According to Mayer, it may well also have a virtual character. Specifically, he cites the example of Bitcoin. Raises the digital currency so soon from the Euro? Not necessarily. According to Mayer of the euro need not necessarily disappear, especially since the active monetary system offering especially for the euro zone, because it was working completely without a state. Mayer's judgment: ""Should the euro survive, he must be repositioned as active money. As a passive money he is doomed to failure. ""
&gt; 
&gt; If you believe his statements, it is not just the euro, but we are all doomed. Namely, if we do not use the financial crisis as a ""chance of the century"", ""to replace our dysfunctional monetary system by a better one."" Otherwise, we will stagger from the financial crisis in the money crisis and destroy the foundations of our prosperity, warns Mayer. "

Bitcoin just isn't the sort of investment you think it is. The key point of it all is, you can actually do something to contribute, which will make Bitcoin better, all of which is supposed to be incentivized by your investment in it. This is another reason why, interestingly, Bitcoin will continue to preserve a core anarchistic audience, because they are less likely to be affected by game theoretic dilemmas and ""divest"".

Now, what will happen is, this sort of euphoric investors will leave, price will suffer, those who are interested in building up this system will remain and continue building it until people realize again that it's not going away and euphorically invest again. That how it's been happening for the last 4 years I've been actively observing.

Usually I just ignore the BS and focus on the important. Recently, that was impossible due to nearly every thread at the top dedicated to freakouts over a large pool getting close to 51%. But this is not new. It's happened before and it will happen again. The important thing to know is that 51% does not equal a 51% attack. 




This whole thing is classic FUD (in a literal sense, as opposed to intentional FUD *pushing*). We talk about bubble cycles a lot in here, and this freakout is what I call the noob cycle. New bitcoiners who never really thought about it before are alarmed when they realize that *the success of bitcoin as a global economical disruptor is not a sure thing*. If it were, the price would already be $1M per, or whatever the value at peak adoption will be.



[This post highlights](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/27mjzu/wed_like_to_pay_forward_1_of_our_bitcoin_business/) the severity of the ridiculousness. In this case, an unwitting but well-intentioned individual is offering to donate 1% of their bitcoin profits to a CENTRALIZED entity that theoretically will help against the highjacking of the network by a bad actor. The problem is, one can never truly know the intent of an individual, let alone an organization comprised of many individuals, and which may be subject to coercion by another group or government... which is one of the primary reasons bitcoin was created in the first place--to be trust**less**.

This person wants to give money to a centralized defender of the network but *if* GHASH is a good actor then they are already the single greatest guardian against bad actors. With 40%, the chance of anyone else getting a majority is nearly nonexistent. The caveat to that is, if a large government were to spend a measly billion dollars to destroy the network, nothing would stop that. And so we should not freak out about something that we cannot control. The best we can do is be informed about all known failure points and apply that knowledge when assessing the risk of bitcoin as a speculative instrument. If that unknown is too much for you, then simply get out of bitcoin.




I don't think these newer bitcoin users have much bitcoin, but their freakout sessions may have a sobering effect on the community regarding unknowns in general and I think unknowns have a lot to do with the ""flat periods"" that /u/lowstrife has [been so good at pointing out to us](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/27o5wa/daily_discussion_monday_june_09_2014/ci2q1na)."

You should realize that the reason we use(d) both silver and gold as money is because gold has too high a value density to be used for small transactions.

Your argument will go a lot farther without the equivalent of a playground taunt. How about some evidence to back up your claim that Netflix gets 1%, or near it, beyond conjecture? If you have been to business school (as if an MBA even warrants bragging rights anymore; it's the graduate equivalent of underwater basketweaving unless it comes from a small handful of schools) I hope you learned that numbers and facts win arguments, not semantics akin to ""businesses cut deals because they're businesses and that is what businesses do!""

 I'll agree that whatever they pay, it's probably a very good rate, so maybe even 3.5% is high. (Doesn't really change the validity of my argument, since whether it is 5%, 3.5%, or less, I can guarantee it isn't as low as using Bitcoin as your payment system.)

Also, since all of my examples are US-only, so long as being pedantic is en vogue, unless you have insider information, their most recent earnings call declared just under 30 million US subscribers. 

And finally, also forcing me to question what, if anything, you learned at business school, you seem to believe that Netflix would get a large discount purely based on the fact that they lose nothing in the event of fraud:

First, I agree that they lose nothing, but I expect the RIAA and MPAA might argue this point. I'm not sure what Netflix thinks about piracy, as far as whether they lost anything. I guess since they stream, and it isn't p2p, they are out some fraction of a cent or perhaps a couple cents for the bandwidth through their peering agreements with CDNs etc. In any case they are out more than Disney is when something is watched via torrent without payment. 

Second, and this is really the crux of your cluelessness, credit card companies almost *always* revert the payment and leave the cost to the merchant. Even when it is something physical; reimbursement of merchants for the chargeback almost *never* happens. Visa et al refunds the customer, pulls the funds back from the merchant, and that is it. So, that is good for Netflix and Bitcoin, as it makes Bitcoin's lack of chargebacks a negligible risk for their business model; but it seems to have *jack fucking shit* to do (arguments are more valid if we add *fucking*) with whether a card company would offer a discount. 

So, what is your point exactly? And why are you replying to multiple comments by me in this comment tree with the exact same thing?"

First of all, yes, without a doubt, bitcoin is a currency right now. The bar is actually rather low for something qualifying as a currency. In prison, cigarettes are a currency. Within a small group of people, there's a common medium of exchange, and this is undoubtedly true of bitcoin. It's a currency, and the group of people which use it is growing. 

Whether or not it's ""money"" is a different, squishier question, and it depends on where you draw your lines. There is no objective definition for what ""is"" and ""is not"" money; so let's not act like there is.

Second, the old man (as much as he's wrong) does bring up good points. He's asking the question: must all blockchain activity in the future require Bitcoin? A valid question, without a clear answer.

They buy up a huge amount of hashing power, build a facility to house their miners, suck up a huge amount of electricity and then cash out virtual currency to pay the bills and make a profit. The only problem with this is it drives the price down as they are not holding. That said, at some point it becomes not worth it to cash it out and they may decide to hold, until the price gets high enough for them to cash out again. Unfortunately this means there is a ceiling on the price and the currency never really gets a chance to grow like it did historically. Also ASICs can centralize a large part of the coins hashing power making a 51% attack easier and more likely. The good parts about ASIC is it adds maturity to the network...it's an evolution that any good coin will go through, even coins with complex code like Darkcoin will eventually have ASIC technology but that will take several years."

Since exchanges are competitive with one another, those exchanges that have yet to adopt LTC look on, and feel a sort of business envy in the sense that other exchanges are profiting from LTC trading volume and they are not, so they rush to implement it so that they can get a piece of the pie.

The only major player (if they can still be considered major) that has expressed interest in LTC has been Mt.Gox. I failed to come up with any evidence through google searches that Bitstamp, and Coinbase have any plans to implement LTC anytime soon. Bitpay has come out and flat out rejected LTC. 

The reality that I am seeing is that Gox is becoming a smaller and smaller player by the day. Their trade volume suffers, the lack of liquidity has crippled its business and caused them to no longer be considered the defacto market for Bitcoin. If they do implement LTC, it won't solve their liquidity problem. If Gox implements LTC, will other exchanges look on with the business envy required to get them to take action? Is Gox still considered a competitive enough threat to even drive the other exchanges to take action?

BTC-E is enjoying a ton of the volume trades in LTC, and has a huge chunk of the overall crypto volume pie. Their volume share is larger than Mt.Gox. You would think that their lack of transparency would present an opportunity for other exchanges to jump in. It'd be easy to take over a very large chunk of the existing LTC trading volume from BTC-E as simply marketing themselves as an exchange they can trust. But even this dangling carrot isn't enough to entice Bitstamp, Coinbase, et al. to adopt LTC.

I'm just curious to see why you may think that Gox would be enough to trigger the business envy required to get everyone else to jump on board when BTC-E has not."

In theory. In practice other coins can come in and saturate the market. Bitcoin isn't unique or uncopiable. Also, the number of coins is technically unlimited because of the divisibility thingy, but instead of bitcoin going to the gazillions, other coins will help to distribute the economic activity.

The concept of liquid voting is also interesting but I'm not sure how it would withstand abuse. I think the way to go on voting is a similar protocol to Bitcoin, but it would likely need to be paired with another protocol for registering people. The concept of decentralization using network agreement and cryptography is more compelling and secure in my opinion.

Yet, digital revolution aside, we need a fallback system that at least works temporarily should a strong enough solar storm wipe out our electronics.

I will start a spreadsheet to monitor the consumption of my mining rigs over time...

I would assume that mining would not be considered capital gains, but if you are buying and selling coins like any commodity then I'd assume capital gains would be most appropriate. I believe the ATO has addressed trading bitcoins before but not specifically mentioned mining. In any case I assume we could apply for a ruling.

So? They are the arbitrary numbers that we chose and the ones we continue to use.

You are trying to make the case for switching to a different arbitrary system, instead of working with the already agreed upon arbitrary numbers. To me that is obviously worse than using SI notation with a bitcoin.

I have been giving you reasons why using a satoshi as the default unit is worse than using uB as the default unit, not telling you why it is scientifically necessary to use SI notation or something. It's just easier this way.

You want to take 1 bitcoin, and divide it by 100 million, and then divide it by some other amount later, or change what a satoshi *means* if we need to subdivide further.

I want to take 1 bitcoin, and divide it by 1000 once or twice, every time we need to make it smaller -- using the notations that have existed since the 1700s. It extends forever cleanly, and is compatible with already widely used notations, both in the bitcoin community and elsewhere.

&gt; So one day I have one satoshi and the next day I have 10 satoshies because a layer of divisibility was added. Why would the base unit need to be referred to differently?

Well that would be horrible. Imagine if we decided to multiply the number of bitcoins you have by 10. I hope it's obvious why this is a problem but I can start listing the reasons if you like.

The net of it is, NC ^TM would have demand, and people would sell bitcoin to fund purchase of NC ^TM.  This is no different from how Ethereum sold ether in return for BTC.

All of these things would impact the price of bitcoin negatively, lower the economic incentive to mine bitcoin, and have all of the other deleterious effects that brings with it.

More detail: 

For bitcoin to thrive, we need bridges that move value from the centralized legacy system to the internet of value that we are all working hard to create. Bridges that touch the legacy system must unfortunately deal with a lot of complex regulations, particularly in the U.S. These regs started out with good intentions (consumer protection), but now often do more to protect incumbents (e.g., Western Union) and reduce innovation (we’ve spent as much time and resources on the law as our product). We would like nothing more than to get rid of all of it, but we are just a few bitcoin enthusiasts, and hiring a huge army of lobbyists is not something we can afford.

The U.S. government decides who we cannot do business with. You may find more detail [here] (http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx). A “person” is someone that has a public record. As far as compliance demands that governments impose, pinging lists is a relatively startup-friendly compromise, as it is cheaply and easily done with code."

1) these things will still have value, people will just have to be more careful with which stocks and which real estate they buy. I think that, in the near future, businesses will monetize by issuing reward points as cryptoequities and this will be the incentive for people to buy and hold. You'll need to be way more careful about which equities you invest in than currently, but it'll still be very profitable to pick the good ones early. Here's a reddit comment I wrote that touches on this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2o1apz/bitcoin_encourages_actual_saving_something_most/cmiua2c

As for real estate, again, it'll still be profitable, just more difficult, to buy low and sell high. 

2) you say in your article

&gt; However, it will also hurt the hundreds of millions of people. It will hurt people who are invested in banks, credit card companies, and money transmitters the most, but it will also hurt investors in all stocks and real estate.

I take issue with how you phrased this. I don't think bitcoin will hurt ""people""... Yes, speculators will lose their investments, and those *securities* will be hurt, but the *people* will be just fine; they'll simply move their money elsewhere. "

Yes. but wall street entities that can't invest in bitcoin (due to regulations or whatever reason) probably won't be able to invest in the ETF either. 

Its purely convenience at this point. As a listed ETF buys can ""buy"" bitcoins using services like etrade. There is, to my knowledge, no real reason this ETF exists.

&gt; computed as zero. Then
&gt; the central checkpointing is used to ensure all nodes can
&gt; agree upon past transactions

Assuming this is the truth, that the private key to gox's big vault is lost, and that there was no massive hack, it follows that it is possible for the network to allow its recovery as a matter of communitarian interest.

After all, the network is designed to do what the community agrees it should do.

To the point: An extraordinary transaction to an address under the control of a multistakeholder entity, composed by impartial and trusted actors could be allowed through the consensus of miners and developers.

This entity could use mtgox's records to return the coins to all verified gox customers, in a process that could be designed to be as transparent as possible.

Something along this lines is worth discussing with the Foundation, all visible members of the community, and the community itself.

Leaving thousands of people in the cold, on their own, thousands of supporters with projects and the will to work to realise the potential of Bitcoin, in the name of the dogma of irreversibility, would be silly and borderline inhuman.

Bitcoin is what we as a community make it, and given the extraordinary circumstances, bringing those coins back to life through our consensus is the only reasonable thing to do.

There would be a lot of details to discuss, technically, socially, and in terms of the actual logistics of such a process. But because it is not impossible we, as a community, can make it work.

Alt-coins and sidechains offer features that the main Bitcoin chain doesn't have (different confirmation time, asset coloring, DNS alternative in case of namecoin etc...).

You have to pay to use altcoins' features, by buying an alt-coin and risking to lose your investment (the risk you are taking is a cost). potentially, you may also be paying the developer who pre-mined the chain. Also, you're prisoner of the alt-coin, you can't cash out of the alt-coin without renouncing to the features it offers.

This is similar to having to pay license fees with closed source software, and vendor lock in, preventing you to move to a competitor.

On the other side, with sidechains, you don't have to take exposure on anything else than BTC, which is quite stable and safe. You know it's not going to go to zero overnight, it's accepted in more and more places, etc... So there's no cost in using the features side chains offer (or let's say minimal cost). Also, there no lock-in. You can cash out of a sidechain specialized in micro payment, and move your money to a side chain that offers a DNS replacement (a namecoin equivalent). That's full interoperability."

Every time you withdraw money, it's like they're saying ""see you can always withdraw money, so never mind that we don't actually have enough for everyone"". That is similar to ponzi schemes which give some initial return to gain trust. There are also many differences. FRB is sustainable, while ponzi schemes are not. Some may argue FRB is healthy (though I would debate that), while ponzi schemes are universally agreed to be malicious, fraudulent schemes.

Bitcoin is nothing like either of these, and it promises nothing more than the security of a notation in a ledger, which represents nothing more than itself. It has more in common with gold than paper-based, central bank issued currency and FRB systems."

But generally speaking, currencies are not volatile, boring, secure, very low (or negative) rate of return and primarily used as a mechanism of buying and selling. They are a medium of exchange.

For example, pretend for a second that you *really truly* used bitcoin as a currency, and you have been doing so for a few years.  Imagine if you had signed a contract a few years ago with a landlord to rent an apartment for 100 BTC a month.  At the time, that may have been equivalent to 500 dollars.  (See how we already have to compare the exciting BTC to the boring old dollar?  That's another good distinction of a currency vs. an asset.)  You can see how the rapid spike in the value of BTC would quickly put you out on the street, since 100 BTC now would be 60,000 dollars.  Depending on the terms and conditions of your rent agreement, it may even bankrupt you.

It's clear that a business could never use BTC as a store of wealth, because the rapid fluctuations in market value would leave them unable to know if they'll be millionaires at the end of the year, or unable to pay this month's rent.  The one thing that business hates more than anything is uncertainty.  Problems that are known can be planned for and overcome.  


For BTC to become a currency it needs to be **stable**.  This is the exact reason the gold standard was abandoned in favor of paper money, and it's also the same reason that the Federal Reserve has inflation targets, and spends inordinate amount of time monitoring the value of the dollar.  Markets want to know that a dollar is going to change very slowly and very predictably month to month, year to year, decade to decade.  Any type of fixed-based asset like gold or BTC hamstrings the ability to ensure this much-desired predictability. "

It might also be cool to explore how bitcoin impacts real estate purchases in Argentina.  I saw an episode of International House Hunters where an American couple was purchasing real estate in Argentina, and they were very uncomfortable carrying that much cash with them.

Even if they have broken even or better in USD terms, they may be lamenting that they haven't in BTC terms. So I think people will mine even at a slight loss with respect to just the electricity expense until they are made whole in BTC. 

After that point, strength of mining is more dependent on the price staying high. So far, we've never had the chance to find out which you could consider as some sort of second-order speculation. That is, whether Bitcoin will prove its usefulness to humanity long term.

Bitcoin's cost of production basically tracks its exchange rate so I wouldn't count on the cost to mine to support the price. It's going to be utility and scarcity that will be responsible for Bitcoin's success or failure."

You're right.  Attempting to predict a future price based solely upon past ***price*** performance has been proven to be no different than selection through random chance.  But there are many other metrics to define ""performance"" and tons of more ways to estimate potential growth.


As long as the number of new bitcoin users continues to grow, as well as the number of transactions and the rate of merchant adoption, bitcoin will be fine.  And it's price will follow suit.


Despite many comparisons between Bitcoin and M1, Bitcoin's potential market is the world's entire M3 monetary supply ***denominated*** in bitcoin.  At a current growth rate of about 400%, that would take bitcoin about 6 years.  I have no doubt that 90+% of people are ***not*** able to accept a change that radical over a period of time that short.  So I expect the growth curve to soften considerably.


But then again, I've been wrong many times—almost always by underestimating people's ability to accept change."

I'm one of the mid sized sellers on locabitcoins and in association with some of the largest pro-traders on locabitcoins. You are going to need a lot more transparency about your company before we trust you with the large sums of money (30 - 300 coins) that we store at any given time on a site. You have to understand the number of fake websites and fly-by-night companies that we have dealt with over the years.  I would like to know 

1) who owns the company?  

2) Is is public or private?  Where is the company registered that we can verify with Canadian and/or provincial authorities?  For instance my business is registered in Ohio and can be verified on the website by going to http://www2.sos.state.oh.us/pls/bsqry/f?p=100:1:0::::: and searching for EUCLID FRIENDLY COMPUTER SERVICE.   Here you will find my business registry number http://www2.sos.state.oh.us/pls/bsqry/f?p=100:7:0::NO:7:P7_CHARTER_NUM:2264561.  

3) Are you registered with FINTRAC and where can we verify this information?  I have recently registered with FinCen here in the USA.  You can search for my company on the site and find it there. 

4) I would like to see ardeva tokens for some of the principals of the company to know you track back to real people so when our bitcoins go missing, we have some idea where to find you.  This is my ardeva token: https://ardeva.com/verify/A545A2C26B5A3F1A84355695.  They do not release your private information unless you have committed a crime or breach of contract, but they are a trusted third party you can prove your identity to.

Thus far I cannot find a registration on FINTRAC or Registraire des entreprises of Québec. 

Also your withdrawal fees are ridiculous.  The only fee for withdrawal for those who made sell or make purchases should be the minimum network requirement from bitcoin.  If you want to charge the wallet-only people fine.

I think these steps helping to prove your real-world identity would get you a flood of customers.  Right now there is relatively nothing for us to go on.  The entire site could be a big trap.

There is no physical use for a bitcoin, unless you count the actual electrons which are currently representing it.  It's entirely speculative, which means you need use to maintain the perception of value, since that is entirely where it's value is coming from."

If we're talking about coinbase generally, a really interesting trend for me is that fewer and fewer people who use bitcoin are actually holding it. At the same time the comments above suggest that the hardcore community is slowly more interested in holding their coins themselves.

Companies like circle, bitpay, and coinbase... more and more they're settling people's accounts in USD and using Bitcoin in the middle.

This isn't a huge surprise, but I think it will have an interesting effect over the coming years, allowing *the big money* to secure a lot of bitcoin at a very reasonable price before wide adoption leads people to use bitcoin directly instead of as a proxy. For me this means bitcoin speculators need a really long term view."

There have been a few similar things trialed (o2 money?) but I'm not aware of any currently operating.. I think the issue is that visa requires the private keys to be stored on a secure element on the phone.. which can be the simcard.. but then it needs to be done in coordination with the network.. which kindof rules out simple deployments involving downloading and installing an app and setting it up with your bank details. I think it may also be necessary to get permission from google as well.

It's not like apple is doing anything particularly new or innovative here though.. eventually NFC wallet apps will be everywhere and certainly there will be bitcoin wallets that can pay to visa/mastercard paywave/paypass terminals. It's certainly not a technical challenge.. its' just getting permission from the banks/networks/google to let it happen."

I personally am weary of Bitcoin because of the following.

1. Majority of our customers are older, thus odds of having some ask is VERY low

2. Not sure how we would tax it. I know the government hates Bitcoin because they cannot track it easily.

3. The whole volatility of the currency, and the whole security premise. I know the whole concept of how the currency works is secure at this point in time, but the fact that some people use a third party service which is open to security problems.

4. If we need to refund we always refund the same way they paid, I wouldn't want to try to refund using bitcoin. 

In summary I personally am happy we have support for Chip &amp; Pin systems before they are mainstream in the USA along with NFC, that's progressive enough for me. When/if BitCoin becomes more popular (and I hope it does) then I would definitely look at accepting it. "

If I hold Bitcoins and I pay someone USD, the following happens:
1) The Bitcoin gateway owes the trader some Bitcoins instead of me.
2) The USD gateway owes the recipient some USD instead of the trader.

That assumes that there is a trader who holds USD at a gateway the recipient trusts and who is willing to trade them for Bitcoins I hold. If not, the path may be more complex, but the basic idea is the same."

The major friction in any transaction is the exposure of the transaction *and both parties* to theft. 

And bitcoin is next to worthless in that regard. If the transaction is exploited via any number of attacks, there is no recourse, built in. And that shifts the costs of securing the transaction from the network (eg: a part of your 1.5-3% interchange fee) directly to the user, vis a vis the necessity to secure the private key.

Exactly how many people are willing to go through the process to do that? Does it occur to you that it might cost these people more than 3% of all their transaction volume just to secure their own bitcoin transactions, in lost time for training/security upgrades? Does it occur to you that a 1.5-3% interchange might actually be a value added proposition? 

Notice that I'm not saying we can't trim the interchange fee. Surely there probably is some way to do it, but what I'm arguing, is that from an economist's standpoint that 1.5-3% *should* in an efficient market be awful damn close to covering just the actual costs associated with the transaction."

I mean its not really a realistic scenario. Would the ledger still be public? How would you administer the money supply if it is only the fed who is mining? Would it be that you can only get these bit dollars by turning in your actual dollars for them? So, you are proposing a dollar-backed crypto currency? I mean, that's cool and all, but it's not really much different the $ today, which is largely digital. 

I just don't understand how it would really work, the whole point of mining is both to secure the network and distribute the currency, if I am just exchanging my actual dollars for bit dollars I am putting faith in a central institution to manage the money supply and not abuse it...what is the point of that? Just doesn't sound all that different from our current system unless i am misunderstanding it. 

Would the code be closed to the fed as well? I guess my grand answer is no absolutely not for many reasons. The greatness of bitcoin is that it is a basic protocol that anyone can add innovation over at the edges. I don't like bitcoin because of what it is today, I like it because of the potential of what it can become in the future as tens of thousands of people are working on it--on things as basic as making it secure and user-friendly--and as complex as new forms of finance and micro-payments, crowd funding, etc.

So, no definitely, not. It would be nothign like bitcoin. It would have none of the benefits, and be subject to same shenanigans being pulled by the big banks/federal reserve etc etc.

I know of many people who got accounts broken into because of those things. That's why I picked a nonsensical answer many years ago when I set it up, which I later forgot.

With Bitcoin I am very aware of the security features as I can choose the level of security I want. So on my phone I have $20 bucks in Bitcoin that's not protected with a password and easy to spend and lose. But with my phone I can also access a pass phrase protected webhosted wallet which I can use for larger amounts, and I won't lose it even if my phone is broken/stolen. 

Finally I have most of my Bitcoin stored in cold storage on an Armory wallet that has been created on a computer that has never been online. I have two paper printouts safely stored in different locations that can rebuild this wallet from scratch. This wallet is only crackable if someone finds those codes. I gave one to my brother to store so they can be accessed in the case of my death.

* It interferes with the dissemination of truth
* It is costly to enforce (both in money and having a state or big corp. apparatus to monitor everything - see deep packet inspection, etc.)

An example of the first is that I can't say ""H.K. Rowling wrote a book, it says ..."" even though that's the truth. And I'm opposed to ""intent determines if something is a crime or not"" so the fact that I'm speaking the truth is enough for me to consider it not a crime.

Another example of the first is if someone uploads a video of police brutality or something that's important for others to see and their happens to be a song playing on a boombox in the background then the owner of the song, or even the cops, can file a DCMA request to have the video taken down even though no one's going to listen to a shitty version of the song with words or someone getting beaten up over it instead of purchasing the song. It allows too much control over marginally-related items.

An example of the second is that someone can *poison the well* by uploading copyrighted material (or worse, CP) into something like the bitcoin blockchain in an attempt to make it illegal. Such things only work when information itself can be illegal.

Another example of the second is that ISPs are policing for torrents. Once the structure and culture gets in place to spy on people, it can easily lead to censorship."

I used to do that for cash on the side, since in-person brokers can usually sell at a premium over the exchange price.

Doesnt mean it WILL be mined, afterall if its not worth it value wise people will not do it. But just the possibility that mining is possible will make people not hoard coins due to the fact that they will go down if everyone starts to hoard them like bitcoin is starting to do.

The biggest problem with ""bits"" is that it doesn't have the word bitcoin in it, which doesn't work well for brand new users who don't know what a `bit` or a `satoshi` is. We want them to know they got bitcoin.

distribution relative to what? if you have only a small percentage of a coins userbase ( ie the miners) receiving gaining possession of the coins, then it's inevitable that the distribution of coins is going to be highly centralized among only the ""miners"". asic resistant coins will be less centralized compared to asic coins, but still highly centralized in relation to the ratio of nonminers to miners. my point is that securing distribution by making sure it's spread out among many people is not the end all and be all - just look at bitcoin for a perfect example of how a coin can be highly successful and be highly centralized. its not make or break. its a benefit but it's not a mandatory requirement. if it were then bitcoin would be failing. thus vert has a benefit but its certainly not any guarantee or requirement for widespread adoption.

Please read my translation below trying to wade through the academic / corporate gobbledygook.   

Conclusion.
The proposed reengineering is much more complex than Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin. However, the complexity of the proposed system offers compelling benefits - mainly the avoidance of thermodynamic effort which is currently $490,103,250 annual rate, and growing an average 10x each year. Rewards are reallocated from proof-of-work, to the providers of decentralized network infrastructure, and to stakeholders as dividends. The paid-for enterprise network design is scalable to handle all the world’s transactions. 

Much of the complexity of the proposed system results from verifiable untrusted cooperation, allowing commonsense teamwork to rationalize the routing of transactions to specialized peers, and the synchronous maintenance of a replicated definite blockchain. As a result, customers and merchants receive sub-second transaction acknowledgement.

The proposed Bitcoin system is to be deployed in early 2016 as a hard fork of the blockchain within the Bitcoin network, following a year of public system testing. Launch is conditioned on wide acceptance among Bitcoin users, payment processors, developers, exchanges, hosted and customer-operated wallet providers, and the Bitcoin media.          

Translation

The Bitcoin network currently requires $500 million to operate. This cost is escalating at ten times per year. The proposed solution is a hard fork to a PoS system in early 2016 for testing of potential sub second transaction times. while still maintaining the current protocol. The changeover will occur once the community to accept it.

You have to remember this isn't new even bitcoin does it and always has.. We also want to be fair to the miners.

Likewise TX Fees will adjust and will lower in the future.

Though again we always allow the option of people compiling and changing the 2 lines of code to get around it. This is just to at least enforce the majority to abide by fees. When you think about it I myself see no reason. If you buy anything online, or in person there is some sort of fee be it tax, fees merchants have to pay, or CC fees etc. We have chosen to keep them as low as possible but I do understand myself issues they may cause. So this is a ""Soft mandatory fee"" which can be removed with work."

Bitcoins can be traced through the Blockhain, so I would call the bitcoin pseudo-anonymous. People have bought alot of illegal things with it, because of the pseudo-anonymous nature of the crypto-coin, but the same goes with fiat money (though I agree that it's easier and safer with bitcoins!).
And the trust issue is pretty much solved, as long as you deal with the currency online. The issue is when you deal offline.

The security issue is online, though, and that's the primary concern as I see it right now. A virus could potentially steal your Bitcoins. The workarounds is cold storage, but then you would have to be quite tech-savvy, which makes the Bitcoins useless for the non-tech-savvy people - and that's the issue. It's made to be ""the peoples coin"", but right now it's the tech-savvy peoples coin.

To say that the Bitcoin only helps to undermine power structures *by making illegal activities more accessible* is in my point of view misunderstood. I know that's what the news tells you, but it also makes the banks less powerfull by not having fees on inter-national transactions and withdrawals.

&gt; I thought we could seek to decrease the usage of money and use it on less goods/ services. We could replace it with our own cryptocurrency, or do away with it.  
  
Absolutely.  By using the conventional dollar less, we allow the owner of the currency (feds and corporate) to have less power.  It would be better to use local currency, one which is owned democratically by communities.  Which is why you conclude:  
&gt; Communism but with money  
  
Indeed.  More appropriately, Communism but with currency- although, currency does not necessarily relate to capital (such is the case with labour vouchers), so no addendum to the conclusion is needed.  
  
Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and litecoin, indeed fulfill the role of adding competition to the market of currencies, but it is still controlled non-democratically by those who a) have access to such technology of participating, and moreso by b) those who have access to powerful technology capable of creating their own money: these individuals had benefited off of the capitalist system by acquiring profit in order to purchase these means.

A sidechain effectively allows you to update your own coins without affecting anyone else's.

&gt; What about if there was a significantly large attack by an advantaged aggressor?

You would have to be more specific, but I'm confident that Bitcoin's incentive mechanisms tend to undermine aggressive attacks. I.e. it may be the first tool that absolutely trumps the state.

&gt; Can Bitcoin protect itself by freezing or going temporarily offline if attacks of that sort were detected? Can these attacks be detected even if not by a purely algorithmic mean?

Yes the network would quickly detect malicious nodes and should route around them. We won't know for sure until it happens."

(and that work involves mixing the random number with your private key, so you also prove you own your private key).  however, if that random number is revealed or if you use the same number twice (and thus the output of the work you did with it is the same), your private key can be revealed.

the R value is a number that is the result of the work on that secret random number, which is called the K value.  blockchain accidentally picked non-random K values for a short time, and people caught onto it by looking at the R values, which are public.

that was a programming mistake on their part which caused the public signatures made when you made transactions on their website, to basically give away the private keys (since those signatures, and the R value contained in the signature, are public).  additionally, that same bad programming was used to create new ""random"" private keys for new accounts for a short while, and somebody guessed that that might have happened and started looking for guessable private keys based on that bad programming... and found some.

that is not a problem with the bitcoin core protocol.  the bitcoin core protocol specifies that that K value must be random and not re-used, and the vast majority of clients, including electrum, do it properly.  there's even a new standard called RFC-6979 that lays out a specific way to generate those random k values which can never be messed up, so if you use that standardized way of generating them, you will always have safe K and R values.

as far as i know, electrum works properly and you are safe -- although you are right to be concerned.  any fuck up by them, or more likely by you, can compromise your bitcoins.  bitcoin isn't ready for mass adoption yet because of that -- the general public has never before needed to actually have good security.  you've always had your money held by a bank, and your e-mails held by google, and if your account gets hacked you could also scan your ID and they'd give access to it back to you.  but bitcoin is different -- with bitcoin, you are in complete control and if you dont secure them, you have no one else to turn to if things go wrong.  there is no recourse if you fuck up.

if you don't know anything about computers or computer security, you run an extremely high risk of one day losing your bitcoins, and i would recommend to you to use third party wallet services, like coinkite or coinbase or circle, and make sure you only ever access them on your home computer, not any public computers.

if you care about your self reliance, i'd certainly recommend taking the time to learn enough about bitocin and security to be comfortable using it, and i'd also recommend learning about PGP and Tor and other encryption tools.  these are things that can help you guarantee your rights.  but it may not be worth the effort to you.  plenty of people live very long and happy lives ceding control of themeselves to others.  that's not for me, but it's certainly easier and i understand the appeal.  and i genuinely feel bad that the tools to enable freedom and self-reliance aren't safer and easier to use for non-techie people.  but sadly, that is the state of things.  you'll have to decide where your priorities lay and how much effort you want to put into the various measures that can help you.  i think learning to safely use bitcoin is worth the hassle.  you may disagree."

I would dispute this.  Altcoins are on the way out.  I think as Bitcoin becomes more well established and the network effect continues to work, altcoins will be viewed with greater and greater skepticism.

&gt;Currently there are only ~3.1 people who are funded and specifically paid by their organization to work solely on the Bitcoin protocol

The protocol itself is fine the way it is, and could continue running for the next hundred years while providing a very valuable service.  Constant updates aren't necessary, nor are they particularly expensive.  The core devs also own many BTC and they will appreciate as the network is more widely used.  So they already have a financial incentive to see the project succeed.

&gt;The issue, as Vitalik Buterin and Sams have discussed, is that Bob, the miner, collects the fees on the transaction of Bob’s (winning) block, but the costs of processing those transaction is incurred by the entire network, as every node must verify every transaction (tx).

Mr Buterin ignores the massive incentive for miners to cooperate and see the blockchain secured.  Incentives don't have to be direct - they can be indirect, and just as effective.

&gt;In addition, these funds went to semiconductor designers, not software developers or the actual ecosystem itself.

This is because software is cheap relative to hardware.  Sorry.

&gt;This is intentionally hard coded but as noted above, to increase the size would effectively lead to a variety of consequences (such as centralizeation [sic]).

Satoshi foresaw greater centralization of mining, and acknowledged it.  He (rightfully) didn't view it as a problem.  Notice, however: mining pools are actually rather diverse and decentralized now, compared to the past 5 years.  We aren't seeing the predicted trend toward greater centralization yet, contrary to popular belief.

&gt;Adam Back and Austin Hill have proposed a method for capitalizing off this underutilized capacity via merged mining with sidechains in an upcoming venture involving several other core developers.

I'm very excited about this, and I think Adam Back is one of the smarted and most respectable people in Bitcoin today.

The price is the price is the price. We get a fair bit of variance of course, and the liquidity still isn't quite there (which is the reason why). Day to day moves of 5% are still fairly common, and they don't necessarily reflect a change in value.

Adoption in bitcoin can mean more than one thing. It can be adopted as a unit of account, a store of value, as teleporting magic money (medium of exchange), and as a precisely divisible asset (down to 8 decimal places right now).

As a medium of exchange, bitcoin is far more liquid than fiat and so any company (like coinbase, bitpay) needs less of it to handle their operations, especially if customers spend their BTC quickly with merchants which instantly convert into fiat. Handling all transactions in house is a lean operation.

This kind of adoption does not produce scarcity. Sure, companies like coinbase hold lots of BTC in reserve, but even this is being hedged to insulate themselves against losses due to price declines. So even as they build a reserve, their perfectly balanced bets against BTC appreciation holds prices stable."

I've watched coinmap grow from 2200 Bitcoin listed businesses to the current 2600 worldwide. Particuarly, I've been watching Colorado since recreational marijuana became legal Januaray 1.
 
As many of you may know, legal marijuana dispenseries are not permitted to bank and therefore must remain a cash business. Such practices are foolhardy - sercurity is a burden in addition to one's own product. But billpay also present complications, and the growing industry in legal pot merchs have been dismayed by this for a decade. In the same breath, I will point out that it is in the Feds interest to keep dispenseries from banking, because much of that cash is scooped up in 'raids' of these legal establishments for 'breaking rules'. These confiscations of cash are the cream of marijuana dispensery raiding. Aside from funding an entire department, these monies find their way into many, many pockets.

So it seems Bitcoin and Marijuana would help each other out greatly; but a few things make Bitcoin and Legal marijuana wary of each other:

1. Silk Road - Boincoin community, as a general rule, run screaming from anything involving drugs - and at this point in the U.S. - marijuana is still just drugs. Until the Feds change the law.

2. The U.S. Government: Marijuana, just coming off a 70 year prohibition, is not racing to start handing out sales reciepts for all this 'legal' pot; even though they stand up and declare the right to sell marijuana legally, they know in the back of their mind that it's not legal in the eyes of the Feds. And  although the cryptocurrency is labeled as anonymous and untraceable, it is not. It could certainly become admissable in a court of law.

But there are substantial rewards for the ones who do decide to implement Bitcoin with Marijuana sales, for both Legal Marijuana and Bitcoin.

1. Patients/recreational users feel discomfort going to purchase; in fact, forcing your clientle to bring cash puts your clients at risk.

2. Including cutting down on cash volume, a dispensery could not only pay suppliers and payroll, but a wallet can preserve a savings from the prying hands of a 'raid'.

Bitcoin could use pins on coinmap, but in addition to that, every transaction is recorded into the block chain, and the longer transaction history bitcoin has, the more it will succeed.

Things to be concerned with when determining whether to accept Bitcoin for marijuana include:

1. Whether of not you can be construed as a money transmitter; FinCEN is on an ass-pounding rampage

2. Laundering laws with the DEA

3. A payment system who is willing to business. Coinbase and Bitpay both have restrictions on controlled substances in TOS agreements. A pot raid and laundering charge could tie up bitcoin in a pay service, much like Mt Gox - U.S. operations.

I, for one would love to see a marraige between Bitcoin + Legal Pot: they compliment each other and stand for the same principals.

As for Bitpay, it would be interesting to see if they allow alcohol purchases or pharmacy prescriptions. There is no difference, especially where the sick are concerned."

People are arguing that we should be making the case for no regulation, or at least keep the status quo which already provides enough regulation. I wish we could do that as well, but we can see all kinds of forces lining up demanding that Bitcoin be heavily regulated - law enforcement, banks and payment system reps, opportunistic politicians, etc. They're crying terrorism and child porn and using all the dirty tricks. It looks like a nasty fight is inevitable.

Allaire has the reputational chops to put a positive spin on Bitcoin and to steer the regulators away from effectively killing the bitcoin-fiat interfaces. His motives are selfish, but does that matter? 

There really isn't any way they can co-opt Bitcoin. Not where it matters, anyway, and that's at the protocol level. The reason is simple: any changes they introduce into the protocol will be treated as damage and will be rejected. The blockchain that follows government rules will fork and will be ignored and its value will go to zero. 

To me the main goal is to keep regulators at bay long enough to allow Bitcoin to monetize and for adoption to hit a critical mass. Once that happens, years from now, we can declare victory, because the government will find itself on the outside looking in to a multi-trillion dollar distributed global economy.

&gt;__Bitcoin__ is a [peer-to-peer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) [payment system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_system) and [digital currency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency) introduced as [open source software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) in 2009. This money-like informational commodity is often called a [cryptocurrency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) because it uses [cryptography](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) to control the creation and transfer of money.   Conventionally, the capitalized word ""Bitcoin"" refers to the [technology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) and [network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network), whereas lowercase ""bitcoin"" refers to the currency itself. 

&gt;Bitcoins are created by a process called mining, in which computer network participants, i.e. users who provide their computing power, verify and record payments into a public ledger in exchange for transaction fees and newly minted bitcoins.  Users send and receive bitcoins using [wallet software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin#Software) on a [personal computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer), [mobile device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device), or a [web application](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application). Bitcoins can be obtained by mining or in exchange for products, services, or other currencies. 

&gt;Bitcoin has been a subject of scrutiny amid concerns that it can be used for illegal activities.   In October 2013 the U.S. [FBI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI) shut down the [Silk Road](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace\)) online [black market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market) and seized 144,000 bitcoins worth US$28.5 million at the time.  The U.S. is considered Bitcoin-friendly compared to other governments.  In [China](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) new rules restrict bitcoin exchange for local currency.  The [European Banking Authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Banking_Authority) has warned that Bitcoin lacks consumer protections.  Bitcoins can be stolen and [chargebacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargeback) are impossible.  In 2014 the US IRS ruled that the bitcoin should be treated as property rather than currency.

The idea was to let this thread occur more naturally with people posting exchanges that they themselves can vouch for, not to post every scammer under the sun.

We could probably fill this page with 1,000 domain names that claim to exchange Namecoins for you, but what would be the point? What about specoin.com? Remember those 'fr33 bitc0rns' links you saw everywhere? They do not need to be reviewed... Even though they claim to exchange Bitcoin and Namecoin.

There are really only 2 or 3 places that anybody in their right mind would exchange Namecoin at the moment or so it seems, and if that's the case then just let it be.

[Why would you vouch for vircurex](http://www.reddit.com/r/Namecoin/comments/27x30q/reputable_exchanges_that_deal_in_namecoin/ci59d8e) for example if you had never used them and were unaware that they were scammers? That does nobody any good."

The market value is starting to reflect that. You mention aurora coin as being one of the biggest pump and dumps of all time. That it was.

Hope is not an investment strategy. Bitcoin was different because you were betting on the first of a new technology. Litecoin is a speculative coin that no one uses currently and the market value is starting to reflect that.

The inherently great things built into bitcoin; the ability to move money without expensive transaction fees, the near real-time confirmation of the transaction (it takes a bank 4 days to deposit a check still?), and the fact that it is nearly impossible to counterfeit make it extremely tempting to pick up.  Say I'm an e-commerce business and I know that if you are paying with a credit card, my processor is taking like 3% + 30 cents every time.  I also probably need to wait 7 days for the deposit to actually take place and then I have to wait even longer for it to clear into the business bank account.  With bitcoin or any other crypto, I can keep that transaction fee for myself (or better yet, pass it along to my users/consumers) and I can instantly use my crypto to buy something else without even needing to change it into fiat first.

So how relevant is it that bitcoin is like $820 or w/e right now?  Not that relevant because with these types of features, whether its worth $1 or $100,000, as a business with the size of its marketcap being pretty healthy and the savings I get from the payment processors I am making MORE money.

It's important to take nothing at face value, or at least, to know when you are taking something at face value that might not be true. There is a lot of value in asking, ""What ulterior motive could someone have for presenting this information?""

&gt; This means that Grams knows the DNM wallet of the vendor and the Coinbase address of this vendor.

I have seen you say this before, and here is the part I don't get: how does Grams or LE or anybody link the DNM wallet back to the vendor? Helix doesn't see a DNM wallet. All Helix sees is an inbound BitCoin address. That address could belong to anybody--and as I understand it, marketplaces act as ""tumblers"" themselves because you don't ""own"" bitcoins in your wallet. You just carry a balance, and when you cash out, the marketplace moves some bitcoins from THEIR wallet to your destination address. So there is no single Bitcoin address that is associated with any single vendor on any particular marketplace. So I don't see any way that Grams could link a ClearNet address to a DNM vendor with any certainty."

It was just as long with bitcoin.

I think we need to up the memory requirement of scrypt, if not switch to a whole different proof of work altogether. Nothing will STOP ASICs from coming, but we sure can do a lot to lessen the advantage they have over CPUs by increasing the memory requirements for a single hash. 

Easy access to mining is, in my opinion, a core feature of DOGE and we shouldn't just accept that ASICs are coming and no one will be able to mine with their laptops anymore. That's bullshit; we can do something about it. 

Memorycoin 2's proof of work algorithm only nets GPUs about a 2x increase over a nice CPU. That's a damn good improvement over what DOGE has. Granted, it's not scrypt, but my point is making it more GPU/ASIC resistant is possible."

There is very little difference between the current generation of cyrptocurrencies and like ive always contended, it will come down to which coin has the best marketing/sales that will determine is acceptance. Dogecoin without question has the best community and thus has superior marketing/sales and its price rise is not only justified, but still well off where it should be. Why is litecoin a better store of value? Why is bitcoin better? The fact is they arent. They're not worse either, they just dont have what dogecoin has. Andreas Antonopoulos says bitcoin is far superior because of the bitcoin platform, but contends it isnt perfect by any means, but sometimes ok technology is ""just good enough."" Well perhaps the technology that is Dogecoins and its scypt platform is good enough. To suggest otherwise is contradictory. Bitcoin is great. Litecoin is great. Dogecoin is great.

A couple outstanding questions/clarifications, as someone who did not have the knee-jerk reaction that this would be bad for dogecoin, but is not entirely sure it would be good, either -- and as a holder of both dogecoin and litecoin:

 - With a merge, you can still just mine litecoin, but cannot just mine dogecoin, correct?  So this would require widespread adoption by pools, of which there is little assurance.  For example, most bitcoin pools I've seen don't offer merged mining with namecoin, even though namecoin is well known within the cryptocommunity and is really interesting in its own right.  I feel there would need to be stronger interest from the LTC community for the benefits of added hash power to prove true.

 - How would P2Pool work?  I know you said you'd need to maintain both blockchains, but dogecoin has lite wallets available, so that's not strictly the case.  Also, would there be a fork in the P2Pool, with some nodes mining only litecoin and some both?

IMO, USB miners aren't worth buying into at all. The hashrate you get off of them will never pay back your initial investment, more so than any other type of ASIC.

For example, the Gridseed Scrypt/SHA-256 miner can mine 300KH/s+ on Scrypt or 11.25GH/s on SHA-256. That Gridseed costs $75. Each USB miner there can do 1.6GH/s for $30, so to match the Gridseed you'd be paying almost $210.

If you want to buy a small ASIC, particularly for Scrypt mining, the Gridseed Orb is the way to go. Don't expect to make a return on one of those any time soon either, but USB miners are just a flat rip-off."

1. When you spend Bitcoin the transaction gets broadcast throughout the web to miners who are listening.

2. The Bitcoin network makes a 'block' of transactions and does some internal maths.

3. The maths goes something like this. Add up all the coins that were spent in the block, divide it by X. Then say this number has to be less than 100. (That's simplifying, it's harder than that)

4. The Bitcoin network gives the miners the equation (without giving X), and they have to solve it.

5. Once they solved it all the transactions in the block becomes 'confirmed' and the one who solved it get 50 Bitcoins.

6. The Bitcoin network sees how long it took, they aim for 10 minutes. If it took less then they make the equation harder, more then they make it easier. (Generally by adjusting the number 100)

7. Rinse and repeat

This system serves two purposes. Firstly it prevents people from double spending, basically spending the same coins twice before the network has time to adjust the books. And secondly it makes an inventive for people to not break the system, gotta lot of computing power? Instead of trying to hack Bitcoin just mine and make some cash.

The maths comes down to guess and checking to find X. So you can dedicate your computer to trying a few number, when the answer is found you get Bitcoin equal to how much you helped out.

If you are collecting your wages in dollars, and taking half of them and swapping into Bitcoin, the price of Bitcoin will rise, and the value of your Bitcoins will rise, however the value of the dollars decline. So from a cash on hand standpoint you probably break even, the amount you gain in Bitcoin you invested in is offset by the decline the value of your dollars. The problem is you signed a contract to trade your labor for a fixed dollar amount in the future, which is rapidly declining in value (as opposed to getting paid in Bitcoins). The real issue is that you are trading your labor for dollars. You go to work and get paid in dollars, which decline in value as Bitcoin rises. So your employer would look at it and say, ""Well I agreed to pay you $50,000 a year, and dollars keep declining in value, so I will raise the price of my end product to make more money since my labor expenses are fixed"". So imagine if your boss decided to charge customers in Bitcoins, he could then take the Bitcoins and sell them for the higher dollar value, pay you back your fixed dollar wages, and keep the profits. Imagine you worked for a grocery store. You would take your dollar paycheck, go to buy groceries, but it would all be priced in Bitcoin. You would now have to trade your dollars for Bitcoins at a significantly worse exchange than when you negotiated the labor contract. Very quickly gallon of milk will go from costing you 30 minutes of work to 2 hours of work. 

So what you really are proposing is that Millenials decide that our value is in our productive capacity. We have the potential to be more efficient than any generation at any time in the history of mankind simply because of technology. We are more interconnected, more tech savvy, and have greater access to information than any group of human beings ever. We have the advantage that we can choose denominate this huge potential productivity in whatever currency we want: Dollars, Euros, Yuan, Gold, or Bitcoins. The Dollar system allows the government to print new dollars and give them to the largest voting block, which isn't Millenials, so we shouldn't denominate our value in Dollars. Bitcoin is much more compelling. If our generation simply said we won't exchange our labor anything but Bitcoins, then the game changes. If Mark Zuckerberg said you can't use Facebook unless you pay in Bitcoins, people who wanted to use Facebook would have to acquire Bitcoins. If Sergie decided Google would do business in Bitcoins preferentially to local currencies that they have to deal with conversions and taxation, then anyone using Google services would need Bitcoins. Now Facebook and Google don't operate in a vacuum, they have to pay employees and suppliers, most of whom do not accept Bitcoins, so they would be forced to change back into dollars in order to pay wages and supplies. However if the majority of their operating costs are wages paid to young developers, and those young developers accept Bitcoins as wages, the game starts to change.

The biggest and fastest way for Millenials to flip the table would be for soldiers to decide they would rather get paid in Bitcoins, not in dollars, not in promised VA Benefits that never seem to materialize, but in a digital currency that they control and can use to purchase what they want. At that point the older generation would have to decide to either pay in Bitcoins, or go fight their own wars.

Now that's a rant."

Bitcoin and *it's* blockchain are one and the same.  Bitcoin and other blockchains or blockchain technology in general are, of course, not the same.

The man in the video made claims to the effect that Bitcoin (the blockchain that is currently called ""the bitcoin blockchain"") could be and would be useful only if we separated it from bitcoin the money.  This is a dangerous myth circulating, that is all too well fueled by widely existing misconceptions within the bitcoin space.  Not only are these two things inseparable, but, even if by some twist of the nature of the universe they were separable; the power and usefulness of blockchain technology (though profoundly powerful in other ways besides money) is massively diminished if we don't ever use this technology to free money from the state and decentralize it.

&gt;Value does not only come from the token of ownership. Value can also come from the utility of a specific blockchain with the token simply being a method of assignment.

I agree.  I'm really not sure where our misunderstandings are stemming from, but I will apologize as well if my posts are not concise or clear.

This is way oversimplified. It's not nearly this easy - to change the signing algorithm means not only that (1) every wallet implementation needs to be updated to the new algorithm, (2) every miner and user of Bitcoin needs to update to an implementation that supports the new signing scheme and (3) every bitcoin address needs to be changed to reflect the new signing algorithm.

So no, we cannot ""always easily"" change the signing algorithm. It's doable, but it will cause a lot of friction as developers update their wallets and users generate all-new bitcoin addresses and stop using their ECDSA ones.

&gt; But you cannot change the mining algorithm in the bitcoin protocol

Changing the mining algorithm is very doable on the level of code - not that much harder than changing the signing scheme. The problem is that the change would need to be accepted by every user (hard fork), just like the signing algorithm change. Arguably miners would be less willing to change the mining algorithm, because they are already heavily invested in hardware, compared to the signing algorithm, which they have no direct stake in. However, this doesn't make changing the signing algorithm ""easy"" or the mining algorithm ""hard"". Either could feasibly happen in the case of a broken algorithm, and either would be far from frictionless.

EDIT: Furthermore, when ECDSA-breaking quantum computing is discovered, it will most likely be by a private party who will keep the technology secret. This will give them the power to silently steal any amount of bitcoin from any (previously spent from) address they want, all while the public still thinks that the technology hasn't been invented yet. Very dangerous stuff."

These are nonsense words so imagine a goofy-ass story out of them. Turn them into anagrams, break them up into blocks and use strategies to memorize the blocks. 

My favorite is the story method. Prior to working with Bitcoin, I built passphrases that I forced myself to memorize that were 256 bits (23 words out of my [favorite custom dict](http://lightsecond.com/password_building_block_dict.txt)) long.

The group focuses on the young , educated &amp; urban in the large cities for a reason. those are the same young people who went back to their small towns and taught their friends and family how to browse the internet and how to use phones to transfer money. The internet is mostly Internet Cafes &amp; mobile data, very few have DSL (that is mostly businesses &amp; Internet Cafes). To be affordable pricing is further broken down into per day/ cheaper per service (access only to facebook and social networks etc.) 
As I said people controlling their finances means that they can direct those finances to solve their pressing issues.

I'm not sure how many freelancers are there , but they could be found at:
https://khamsat.com (not a Sudanese freelance website but with Sudanese freelancers, they get 10% sliced off their pay , by the payment brokers, after the website has taken it's sahre)
https://www.facebook.com/groups/Sudanese.Designer/
https://www.facebook.com/groups/SudaneseWeb/
https://www.facebook.com/groups/sudanese.programmers/

and of course other websites that I know nothing about. I hope that when freelancing is seen profitable &amp; just more will head to that direction , reducing the 40% unemployment.
 
I would love it if e-lance , freelancer.com or oDesk pay out in bitcoin (something many on these sites are demanding in the forums) they are alot better in marketing :-)
But again remember that many of those sites are US based and might not want to be involved in any ""business"" with Sudan.
Also I'm sure you wouldn't hire many Sudanese freelancers :-) , not many speak English all that well. Their best customers will be the richer neighbors (Saudi Arabia is just across the red sea), who speak the same languages. the closer the cultures the easier design tastes and expectations are matched. 

And yes people controlling finances , could mean people controlling politics and their own destiny.
Every $100 dollars an expat sends to his family in Sudan using the traditional methods the government takes a big cut in the form of  the official artificial exchange rate that slashes at least 30% of  the real value of that $100 . when bitcoin is sent to a Sudanese designer, it goes to the designer.

As for Capital Flight , it's a very valid concern, it exists with the current banking systems,  it's a criminal offense that cannot be solved by the bitcoin algorithm, but cashing huge amounts of Bitcoins in another country by an official will need to go through an exchange, and exchanges can ask all sorts of questions pertaining to the source of the money. It has always been said that bitcoin is not 100% anonymous.

Again thank you, few people are willing to spend time researching and studying the situation in a country far away from them ,and discussing that. really appreciated"

So there are definitely fewer females interested in Bitcoin, unless there is some global conspiracy which doesn't allow females to subscribed/post to mailing lists, like Facebook pages and so on.

Also argument about atmosphere/lack of interest in meetups doesn't apply here, as these places are places for intelligent discussions or just sources of information, and they aren't in any way offensive to females.

Now it's possible that the problem is in lack of exposure to the idea, but I don't buy that argument, as in this day and age everybody has same access to same sources of information, and filters it _according to his interests_."

An unscrupulous wallet generator. A Java applet that ran with unrestricted permissions and stole a wallet.

I have yet to see a reported case of someone losing bitcoin due to using bitaddress on a temporarily disconnected computer. I would be interested in knowing about a documented case, though.

Edit: having said all of this, best practice is to only generate/store/use private keys on an offline computer. Barring that, BIP 38 can be helpful.

Bitcoin (or something similar) could carve a niche in that area, but it would certainly be a riskier transfer than going through an institution.  I know that I would rather pay the fee than float a large amount of money into the market and pull it out on the other side.

I'm not so sure I buy the gold/silver bug argument as much.  If it was possible to tie or back a cryptocurrency with gold, I think it would really take off (essentially turning it into a gold ETF that can be used for transactions).  As of now though, Bitcoin really shares no similarities with gold other than the fact that there is a finite amount.  Gold derives its value from truly universal acceptance and (for lack of a better term) its historical credibility in addition to its scarcity.  Bitcoin doesn't have either of the first two right now.

As far as the anti-bank people... I would say that's a case of cutting off your nose to spite your face.  Sure, maybe you can make some money off of price appreciation of bitcoin, but you are losing all security and, as I mentioned before, taking a huge market risk by not keeping your money at a bank.  I just don't think too many prudent people are going to pull money out of an insured product (keep in mind, FDIC insurance is paid for by the banks into what is called the DIF to pay depositors out in the event of a failure and is not paid for by the US gov't) to hold it themselves.

It's about the protocol, like email or tcp/ip or whatever. The internet in 1994 was not accesible at all to the average consumer (text based software like gopher was the most used interface, you had to dial in with your phone and set up a complicated subscription), so it took entrepeneurs to start up browsers like explorer and netscape navigator to make it easier for the average consumer to access its possibilities. Eventually facebook, youtube, myspace and the sorts started the ""Web 2.0"". It sounds new but these were all built on top of the same protocol.

This bitcoin protocol is what people are hyping. Part speculation and part ""believers"" in the protocol.

Dollar cost averaging or buying once and holding is for people who want to take the leap into bitcoin and don't want to actively trade, seeing where things go in the long term. So many people in this subreddit seem to hate that notion. Yes, if you DCA'd all of 2014 you're down year over year. It was a bad year for bitcoin. Could anyone have known just how bad it was gonna be with absolute certainty? If I had a crystal ball I wouldn't need to dollar cost average. But the reality is if I want to make good trades I need to put a lot of work and research into it and actively manage things. That's a fucking *job*. Some people are busy with life and don't have time for that, or they just don't enjoy trading and would rather not do it. But they still think bitcoin is awesome and going to be really big in the future. So DCA is a less risky and a super easy discipline to get a person to put a portion of their portfolio into bitcoin.

As efficiency and scale go up, the network will thus end up less distributed.

How this will exactly translate to the numbers, no clue. But sooner or later, it seems inevitable that the majority of the network must hand up in the hands of a single group. But that's the case for all common proof of work algos (also Bitcoin), and later could mean a year to another decade or so.

This entire discussion was on the fact that running a computer to mine bitcoins will heat a room equally as well as a space heater.  They use the exact same amount of fuel (energy) when they run and produce the exact same amount of heat.  If your goal is to heat a house, you can substitute space heaters for bitcoin miners, and not worry about the extra expense incurred because the side effect of what they do (producing heat) costs the same as operating a space heater and has the same effect."

ACH is slow and that's the Feds job to fix. Credit card use in the US is high and banks make a huge amount of profit off of credit card transactions. When you pay by credit card 3 groups take a cut. The card issuer, the payment network (eg. Visa), and the payment processor. That's a hugely profitable business for banks. 

Now this compares to a country like Canada where EFT is just as slow as ACH.  However Canadian banks did something different. They innovated around the slow bank transfer infrastructure and created a new network (Interac) that benefits consumers and allows for a not for profit debit card network (which is instant and has network fee lower than Bitcoin), then in addition to that created email money transfers that allow anyone to send and receive money from any bank/credit union in the country near instantly though an email and then Interac Online of which Bitcoin exchanges love as it allows for instant deposits. Sadly Interac Online isn't supported by most banks but the email transfers and debit card network is supported by all banks and CUs. 

The not for profit Interac debit network was wide spread before the other innovations and Canadians are actively encouraged through advertising to use their Interac debit card and spend their own money rather than borrow with credit. So banks aren't as driven by profit for the stock holder in respect to credit cards but instead they did something that benefits the consumer as the consumer wasn't going to use the credit card anyways. American banks are to driven by the momentum and profit of credit card use (and even debit card use in the US which is also Visa and what not unlike Canada) to go ahead and innovate around the problem and create a system that subverts the slow and expensive credit card network. Instead America is relies on the Fed to update ACH and banks have no motivation to create a work around.

At least, that's my interpretation.

the danger of a 51% attack is that an attacker can secretly mine without publishing his blocks, and he'll be building up a longer valid blockchain, and then he goes and buys stuff and the site waits for confirmations, and then after the transaction is all complete, he then publishes his longer chain (remember, the longest is the ""real"" one, so his new chain becomes the real one), and that chain doesn't have that transaction, so he has in effect reversed a tx with many confirmations.  an attacker can also slow down confirmations by just mining blocks with no tx in them, so the other 49% are the only ones putting tx's in blocks.  basically, a 51% attack isn't the end of the world, but it means you should wait longer for confirmations (at least 12, because i think the current protocol generates an error if a new longest chain that un-does 12+ blocks randomly appears), and it could slow down confirmations.  in short, it would cripple but not kill bitcoin, and cause a price crash.

but none of that has to do with a fork.

the real reason though that a 51% attack isn't likely from nation-state level actors is because a far better use of funds would be to simply manipulate the market and cause continual giant price crashes so that adoption remains low.  dollar for dollar, that's way more effective at shutting down bitcoin than 51% attacking it.

also, notice how neither attack actually *kills* bitcoin.  that's one of the beauties of bitcoin.  it literally cannot be stopped.  it can only be wounded, and as soon as you stop the wounding, it picks right back up where it left off and keeps on trucking."

For those of you who don't have your own business yet, this is what a chargeback means.

You try to charge your customer even a little amount of $0.50 to cover for postage, but if the customer decides to file a chargeback (say, the credit card data was stolen, like what happene on Target and being tested by online thieves massively in order to re-sell it) the business ends up losing $20 for each one of these chargebacks, and they're very hard to dispute. 

Even though it was really the fault of the credit card institution for not having tighter security, the seller takes all the risk and costs of the dispute.

There are two, distinct namecheap transactions. The first transaction, occurred a week ago and is the one I referenced in the post itself. This was one of the transactions that was listed when I was verifying my recent transactions. This was made by credit card for a whole host of reasons that I've already explained. This charge went through no problem.

Then, yesterday there was a second namecheap transaction, this was the one discussed in my comment. I tried to pay with credit card, and had it declined. It is at this point in which I have to purchase bitcoin (because I don't have enough in my wallet to cover the purchase price) and then make the payment to namecheap with bitcoin.

So to your last line, I have no idea what you think I did or didn't do, but where you say ""you didn't"" what really happened was I did just that. I did do that when I payed namecheap.

And my ""bragging"" was merely about the fact that with bitcoin, even the hoops I had to jump through in this case was quicker than having to deal with my bank. How that is even remotely a fail just does not make even a bit of sense."

If cost to produce is more than cost to purchase, commodity is purchased instead of produced (and vice versa). Eventually, equilibrium will be reached. As markets become more mature, there is much more consistency around the equilibrium level. As bitcoin is in its infancy, one should expect hype cycles, and long lulls where the price/cost equilibrium is found - until the asset is mature enough that price will oscillate around the equilibrium point in a much lower bound.

You see this happen in commodity mining, when demand wanes, the largest miners with the biggest cash reserves withhold supply in hopes to pull the market price back up to the marginal cost to produce mark.

You are correct, bitcoin is most definitely not different."

Here I was, talking about the car and how it was a great marketing tool, but I never made the connection to prices. There's an argument to be made that the price of dogecoins is going to rise after that, especially given that the commentators talked about the car and how he was holding in fourth position for a while.

I have had dogecoins for a while and banked on the halving a week ago *and* the dogecar having some effect on the market, but so far it's been nothing worth noting. It seems like the pump the week earlier was it, and now I'm left with those coins, more jaded each day. The shenanigans around dogecoin are well worth the time, it's a lovely community.

Meanwhile other alts have exploded in value left right and center. It's really quite frustrating. I completely reserve judgement on any rise in alts because I've seen random coins being pumped and dumped all the time, with no really reason behind it. And yet the coin that actually had its mining supply cut in half and put a guy in a race does nothing on the market. Who the fuck knows anything about the 100+ alts who isn't a frequent visitor of bitcointalk, coinmarketcap and cryptsy/bter/moolah? I guarantee you if you asked a random person on the street about cryptocurrencies, you'll probably hear bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and maybe darkcoin because of the recent buzz.

Anyway, what's interesting to me as I've followed dogecoin closely over the last couple of weeks is how utterly dependent on the bitcoin price movement it is at the moment. It's really strange. Back in January/February/March there's been quite the independent swings in DOGE/BTC value, it jumped up and down irrespective of what bitcoin was doing. Yet end of March or so onwards it's following the BTC trend closely. Seriously, just have a look at bitcoinwisdom for cryptsy DOGE/BTC and Bitstamp BTC/USD and compare the two. From March 27th or so onwards, the DOGE graph is starting to mirror the BTC graph more and more (in terms of relative movement) and now it's virtually identical.

What does that mean? The only thing I can think of is that the uncertainty and massive bearish sentiment of Bitcoin is affecting the other coins and holding up any significant upwards movement. I'm certain that a significant upwards breakout in Bitcoin will make the altcoin value skyrocket but so far we're still up shit river with barely an end in sight."

In the same way that you don't need a degree in finance to use a bank, you won't need to know ancap theory to use ancap services, just like at least half of the people using bitcoin aren't ancap. 

We simply outcompete state services with better alternatives.

And it will always be possible to do so because state services are ipso facto exploitative, whereas our alternatives are not.

The easiest model is designing a system that allows investors to observe and multiple independent accountants to securely authenticate and verify the money flow. I would like to see a few companies launched that work this way, and it is perfectly doable currently. Ironically, it is possibly the regulations in place that make it problematic, especially those who make taking in investors without layers of counter parties challenging.

An advanced model will allow companies to be simple programs that run in a decentralized environment. A similar transparent accounting and auditing system will always be required for everything that involves human interaction though.

That said, I don't think that will do much to shrink the blockchain.

In reality, it will become increasingly rarer for people to run full nodes. I haven't done this in ages. But it doesn't have to be something that Joe Average does anyway. Think of the DNS - it is decentralized, yet it requires a decent investment in infrastructure to run a DNS server. That is how the blockchain is increasingly treated: stored in full on smaller numbers of servers, only parts of which are used by clients and any given time.

What are you investing in? Bitcoin has no real utility as a currency, no intrinsic value, no utility in itself, so what value does it have? 

You're ""investing"" in bitcoin because you expect the price to go up, right? Why does the price go up? The price goes up because every person who buys a bitcoin at a higher price expects that they will be able to sell it further down the line to someone else for an even higher price. 

Is this expectation of future demand/rise in prices based on any change in the value/performance of the bitcoin? No, partly because bitcoin simply isn't capable of changing in intrinsic value, but more importantly because it has no value. 

And what do we call this? It's called speculation... What happens to speculative bubbles?

Sure you can make money on a speculative bubble. Consider the housing bubble, tons of people made money off of the crazy speculation. If you stop there, it sounds great for all those people who threw everything they had and anything they could leverage into the market. But when you consider that most of those people lost *everything* and it helped catalyze perhaps one of the greatest economic crashes since the Great Depression, it doesn't sound so great.

The difference between speculation on bitcoin and speculation on housing is that housing has objective, intrinsic value and very real utility. You could expect the crash to bottom out and the market to recover because it was based on something with legitimate value. Bitcoin doesn't have that. When it goes, it's gone, and there's no recovery because there simply isn't anything to recover. *You will lose everything.*"

https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/2pt25f/announcing_reddit_notes/cmzt259

--------------------------------
reddit recently raised a round of $50 million where the new investors agreed to give back 10% of the shares they bought to the community in the form of a ""cryptocurrency"" that was to be ""backed"" by reddit shares. For legal reasons, it is unlikely we will make the cryptocurrency exchangeable for actual shares, since we are not a public company, and therefore it would be illegal to give shares to millions of people. Howevever, we are working on a legal strategy and I'm sure the cryptocurrency will be exchangeable for something of value.

Also, we used the word ""cryptocurrency"" originally, but a better term is ""digital asset"", since in many ways notes will not be like a currency at all. For instance, we are not planning on letting users buy gold with the cryptocurrency (although we haven't eliminated that possibility).

The asset will be based on blockchain technology. As I have said in many previous reddit comments, we are not committing to any particular protocol at this time, but our preference is either for colored coins or sidechains depending on the winds of the bitcoin world in the coming months (the bitcoin world changes very, very fast, and we want to be certain we pick the best technology).

We are being intentionally vague right now because 1) we haven't solved every problem, 2) we don't want to make any promises we can't follow through on. This post is just to update everyone on our progress, and to invite people to follow along with the project at our new subreddit: /r/redditnotes

This was an interesting new idea (""virtual currency"") 20 years ago, but hardly originated with Bitcoin. You can buy tangible real-world items with World of Warcraft gold. There are entire businesses in China, ""gold farms"", which consist of having people play WoW 12+ hrs/day in poor conditions in order to get gold in the game and then exchange it for other currencies (you might call this ""mining"" if you want, but ""farming"" is the term that stuck). Economists and sociologists have written quite a bit about real-world purchases using virtual currencies, and related issues such as money laundering, since the late '90s.

Bitcoin is different in having a decentralized ledger, which is its main innovation. The mere idea that you can buy rugs with virtual currency because people agree it has value is not the new part."

Um, duh?! That's what I said I'm doing! And by lost I mean you are carrying your bitcoins on you, and you drop or lose the thing you're carrying them on. If you were carrying your cash, you're screwed. Sure, you can put your cash into someone else's hands, and spend probably 20% of your economy to keep it safe... Imagine if all that percent of your economy could be used on something other than just keeping your cash safe.

&gt; Are you saying people don't trust their banks?

Lol!!! Are you saying they do? Then why do we have FDIC and so many financial regulations to keep them in check? You would trust your bank even if you knew it doesn't have massive regulatory pressure keeping it in check?

&gt; It doesn't cost ""a massive fortune"" to send money

To send money, you pay to make sure your bank has your money, to make sure it doesn't spend or invest it poorly, to make sure that it's secure enough to not get robbed or hacked, to make sure it will reimburse you if it loses it, to make sure there is a system that your bank and the recipient bank can transfer money, to make sure that this system is secure and is not hacked (which apparently it is), to make sure the recipient is a ""good"" person, and to audit to make sure the money left one account and got into the other account properly. You pay for all that in part by taxes, in part by bank fees and charges on loans and other bank services, and in part by allowing your bank to rent out your money at high interest rates, and give you 0% or a bit more than that in return. It's like, ""I'll give you my apartment for a year, you can rent it out to whoever you want for $1,000 a month, and then you can give me $20 every month for free!"" So, although you don't see it directly, yes, it costs a massive fortune to do something as simple as send some of your money elsewhere.

&gt; You don't send someone $10,000 so they can spend it at Overstock, you send money to pay for rent and emergencies.

Right now you can't spend Bitcoin for rent and emergencies (though in some place you can), but you can already spend Bitcoin on about 99% of things you may need without needing to cash it out. And you can actually cash it out that same day, within a few hours, though it won't be cheap.

&gt; Why not ""Bury it in the ground?""

Because I'm not a redneck, and stupid ideas like that don't cross my mind (can't a curious dog follow the weird smell and dig it out at night? Or anyone else who sees you digging?)

&gt; If bitcoin collapses due to bad investments/whatever (Gox, NeoBee)...

Lol! That's not bitcoin collapsing. Wtf?! :D Yes, if you put your money with an unregulated and uninsured third party, there is a risk it will disappear. It doesn't actually matter if the money is bitcoin or dollars. Bad investments collapse. Thanks Captain Obvious.

The point is that **I have no choice but to use a third party service** if I want to make my cash digital, and thus they better be insured and regulated. I have tons of choices if I'm using bitcoin, from just doing the security myself, to using an insured and regulated bitcoin-storing third party, to using cryptographically secure systems, like multi signature accounts, that don't even need insurance or regulation.

&gt; They'll have bitcoins, not cash. This isn't usable for everyday commerce

And yet I have been using it for everyday commerce since June, so... (And it will only get better)

&gt; Why did you even type this if you intended to compare it to a bank? Normal people keep money in a bank.

Because as you so aptly noticed, I was comparing Bitcoin to cash, which is what it's closer to, not a bank. Normal people who have small businesses typically get paid in cash and have to carry that cash. Even if it's from their place of business to the bank. I'm not even going to go into the fact that a whole lot of normal people can't even get a bank account.

&gt;  No shit a bank is going to ask where $250,000 cash comes from

I'm curious, what kind of houses are you buying where the downpayment is $250,000 O.o

&gt; Where do the Gox people get their backup from?

How are people carrying Gox on their phone or paper? What the fuck are you even talking about? Are you one of those people who thinks MtGox is the Bitcoin CEO or the company behind bitcoin? Or just an idiot who doesn't realize that keeping and losing your money in Gox is analogous to keeping and losing your money with, say, Bernie Madoff?

However, it is still there for a reason, and that reason is that Bitcoin is not particularly scaleable (in its current form), and while we have never actually *reached* the block limit (or even come close) the 1 MB limit is a good approximation of where Bitcoin's scaleability problem becomes a real burden for the network with current technology.

If you have two people and you want to send 1 MB worth of transactions, and then a 1 MB block of confirmed transactions between them, bandwidth or storage is no problem. If you have 6,200 people (approximately the number of Bitcoin nodes) and you were perfectly efficient, you could get by with collectively sending ~12 TB of data. Its a lot for every 10 minute interval, but certainly not impossible, even today.

But what if you want that network to be redundant, self healing, and resistant to attack or ""bad actors"" in the network? You can't just send the data out once to each node, you must have some level of redundancy, and so each node will broadcast each transaction (and then the 1 MB block of confirmed transactions) out to at least several other nodes, and receive several identical copies even after they already have one. The more ""rebroadcasts"", the less efficient the network, but the more resilient. However, more rebroadcasts use up a ton of bandwidth and becomes expensive, leading to fewer nodes and centralization of the network.

You can see how even 1 MB sized blocks would use up enormous bandwidth across the network even with small amounts of redundancy... However, 1 MB block sizes only provides a transaction speed of ~7 transactions per second. Visa processes up to ~2000 transactions a second, corresponding to a blockchain size of ~285 MB *per block*. This level of transaction volume in Bitcoin would be a significant burden on nodes, and would consume massive amounts of bandwidth between nodes even if there were only a few hundred of them and very little redundancy.

Furthermore, while the blockchain's current size is about 20 GB, at a constant rate of 7 transactions per second, the chain would be *growing* at 50 GB / year. (again, difficult, but not infeasable with current technology). At Visa levels of transactions, that growth would be ~14 TB per year, which does not lend itself to individual users keeping a copy of the blockchain running on a local machine altruistically to help the Bitcoin ""cause"" and promote decentralization.

Generally, the solutions to the scaleability problems are centralization and off-chain transactions (as you point out in your comment #3), but then what is the fundamental benefit over other third party services like Visa or Paypal? There are some potential software changes that could help curb the growth (or community based ""checkpointing"" that allow previous transactions to be archived), but there isn't really any solution to the problem of decentralized payment processing being highly inefficient. Think of it this way: most distributed computing networks break up a process and run each part in parallel. Bitcoin however *replicates* the same work across each distributed node because it is trustless. This means that as the network grows, there is no efficiency gained, only more nodes replicating the same work which need to be kept in contact (at some expense to the network) with ""n"" other nodes to maintain resilience against attack. 

As Bitcoin's network grows in size, it gets more robust as a decentralized system, but *less* efficient. High transaction volumes may therefore force it to move away from a decentralized model and towards options such as in-house transactions, with a few (corporate?) entities that can afford to run nodes in order to keep the network running, which allows them to run the services that they profit from.

So, the block limit (and other parameters like ""minimum fees"") are there to help prevent the network from growing in size too quickly until some technology (or the software) advances to the point where it could handle larger transaction sizes while remaining robust and decentralized. If the limit remains in place, fees will rise until enough transactions are prevented to keep the network below 7 transactions/second. If the limit is lifted without some other solution, it will likely lead to centralization of bitcoin, requiring users to trust the motivation and actions of centralized entities that can afford to keep the network running at great personal expense.

1.
---
I've developed a theory that provides a general rule of thumb for evaluating bitcoin business proposals:  the quality of the website is generally inversely correlated with the quality of the product.

On the one hand, you have pretty websites for companies like Circle, the dark wallets, and many altcoins, but what they are providing is not available, buggy, or useless.  On the other, you have services like the middlecoin pool, which has an extremely poor interface but provided a useful service for a time.

This may be for practical reasons as well.  Companies that spend lots of time innovating on their products don't allocate huge amounts of resources on their websites - they spend the time on their products instead.


2.

There are quite a few people here who are looking for some sort of mass adoption in order for the next bubble to occur.  I don't agree that any sort of significant adoption is necessary for the next bubble.  I think that, again, people are assuming that there has already been a lot of bitcoin uptake, so there isn't as much room for growth.

On the contrary, there has not been as much bitcoin uptake as I believed initially, which means every price floor will be higher than most people suspect given a certain level of adoption.  The reason might be that there are a lot more lost coins than anyone believed.


3.
---
There are also some discussions by notable contributors about whether the next bubble will continue to rise without any ""pop,"" given that Wall Street investors have stronger hands.  This thinking is just as foolish as the people who say that bitcoins will fall to zero and not repeat the bubble cycle.

There are many bubbles in assets like stocks and real estate.  There have been bubbles in things like silver, where people lost 7% of their net worth in a single day.  There have been crashes where the entire market falls 10% in 15 minutes due to runaway bots.  Wall Street traders know how to trade in bubbles just like bitcoin traders do, so they aren't going to hold while everyone else is losing money.



4.
---
That said, the amplitude of the bubbles will continue to decrease, so perhaps the next crash will only cost 50% of bitcoins' value.  The most recent crash bottomed out at about 1/3, and the April crash bottomed out at 1/5, although it was actually impossible to buy at those prices with Mt Gox down.  The bubble before that had a 95% drop.

Bubbles aren't going to go away, but the crashes will likely become lesser as time goes on.


5.
---
I still believe that the uptrend of this cycle will begin to ramp up towards the second half of June, like in other bubbles.  However, I think that /u/moral_agent's theory that the bubble might begin more quickly than most people think has some merit.

In the past, like in December, everyone believed that the market would recover once January 2 arrived and people went back to work.  But the price actually started to rise on Christmas, when nobody was at work.  Predictions from people here have been shown to be consistently a week too late in the past.

For some foreigners, here is a lesson in US healthcare.  Americans have had this happen to them before, so it's nothing new.  

I wrote off $520 yesterday because I decided that it wasn't worth my time to pursue any more, given that I hope to make more money working on my mining pool during the valuable hours I have in the evenings.  I will allow the statute of limitations to expire tomorrow.

In this case, I submitted claims to UnitedHealthcare on 2013-05-20, for four appointments with a doctor over the course of six months.  They had accepted all of my claims before that, but now they suddenly need some sort of code called a ""CPP code.""  Their system spit out various errors rejecting these claims and I resubmitted them four times over the course of a year.  They want the doctor to write this code on the bill and resubmit the claim again.  But the doctor's office staff all resigned in protest over some issue, nobody is in the office when I go there because they are on ""summer semester hours,"" and they aren't answering the phone.

UHC won't allow me to simply write the code on the bill, and the doctor's practice is so mismanaged they are nowhere to be found, so my only recourse is to sue, which for only $520 isn't worth the time.  Three years ago, I lost $1600 to UHC in another similar case of ""denial due to obscure new rules,"" although a class action lawsuit later earned me a consolation check for $350.  When people say that the medical system ""works fine,"" this is what they are talking about.

And then another surge who came in after the first peak pissed that they missed the boat (verification delays etc), but then lo and behold, a few positive news items appeared and the got a chance to buy in again on the slow rebound to 1000+ 

I think there are still enough people who paid 900 and up for their coin in the market, people who are going to need a lot of convincing that they bought too high after seeing this price rise twice. People who apparently didn't look at back to notice that that the exact same hype boom / deflate cycle happened last April.

It took several months for all the air to be let out of the last balloon, it will take the same if not longer to do so this time.  Same psychology at work. 

Only possible saving grace, and this is a longshot if your belief is that we are headed for 1200 again any time soon (if ever), is that there are a lot more eyes on Bitcoin this time, and more money in circulation. But most of these players can announce that they are shelving or changing their plans just as easily as they announced them in the fist place.  It's not like they are held to their word for any reason other than to make some hay out of the current media buzz around it, which once it dies down from red hot to room temperature, will not be nearly as useful any more.  

Bitcoin is still useful only in theory at this point; it still is worse than all the current alternatives at everything it does unless you are trying to move money illicitly or speculate. No one who isn't touched with a little of the zealot fever or who doesn't have hopes pinned on BTC/USD  rising dramatically once more, or isn't seeking free media attention would not have any incentive at all to use Bitcoin for anything. Yet. and maybe ever. That's really still an unknown at this point, regardless if the magic 8 ball happens to say 'signs point to yes' right now.  China, the Supreme court, the IRS, hell even Oprah Winfrey could have more impact in that outcome right now than 100,000 of the most fanatical Bitcoin supporters ever could.  

And I say this as someone who is fairly bullish and unlike, I am quite sure, 99% of the other folks in this sub I am putting my career where my mouth is, taking a big risk to help develop and pitch a blockchain-powered network TV gameshow in hollywood, working with people who already have a network show on the air. This is their next project. 

I am upbeat on the concept of bitcoin and especially the broader concept of distributed social stakeholding systems, but I am not delusional about getting rich quick off speculation.

I'm not in the market for a Bitcoin epiphany here, so the hard sell isn't necessary. The question is whether you value it higher as a payment system, or as an investment.

&gt;How much is one bitcoin worth? if one coin is worth about $50, do you really want to spend 1 coin for a pet? I never heard of half-bits or quarter-bits.

&gt;Current rate is 1 bitcoin worth over 500 dollars. To whom I don't know since I don't understand the currency, but I have no idea why you'd want to spend a bitcoin to buy one or two items from the store if it is worth that much. Blizzard store takes exact change.

Essentially, if you believe in bitcoin, you are of the Austrian school of thought regarding economics. Keynesians believe bitcoin will suffer from crippling deflation. However, I personally believe it will simply promote smart consumerism. Buy what you need and save what you can. People realize if they don't spend, they don't gain value on what they store. Also, if people don't adopt, the units do not gain value. Spending and adoption are crucial. And I'm pretty surprised at how bitcoin is doing in both of those regards. Spend some. Save some more. "

I love how because MtGox can't keep track of their coins they think Bitcoin is some how at fault.
